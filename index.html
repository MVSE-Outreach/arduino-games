<p>
Welcome! This workshop will show you how to build and program your own
arcade games using the Arduino electronics platform.
</p>

<p class="section">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/getting-started"><h2>1 - Getting Started</h2></a>
This step tells you the materials and software you will need to complete this
workshop.
</p>

<p class="section">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/using-the-screen"><h2>2 - Using the Screen</h2></a>
Here, we will build the circuit that connects the screen to the Arduino, and
learn how to display basic shapes on the screen. We will also go over how to
connect the Arduino to the computer and program it using the Arduino IDE.
</p>

<p class="section">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/input-buttons"><h2>3 - Inputs</h2></a>
All arcade games need controls! This section will show you how to connect
buttons and dials to your Arduino and write code to interact with them. We can
then start displaying things on the screen based on whether our buttons are
being pressed!
</p>

<p class="section">
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/ping-pong"><h2>4 - Let's Make Games!</h2></a>
Now we know everything we need to make some games! This section details a few
ideas to get you started, and gives some example code for ping-pong. If you
can complete this section, carry on and make the coolest game you can!
