Arduino Games
===================

This workshop teaches participants how to use the Arduino LCD screen to build
some basic games including an etch-a-sketch and ping-pong.

The workshop was originally run as part of the Digimakers@Bristol series of
events and is now available to anyone.

If you are a teacher wishing to adapt any of these materials for use in
lessons, please contact Ben Marshall, who's details are found at the end of the
tutorial document, or Caroline Higgins who organises the Digimakers events.
