<h1>Using The LCD Screen</h1>

<p>
In this section, we will build the circuit that connects the LCD screen to
the Arduino, and learn how to program the screen to display different
shapes, colours and text.
</p>

<h2>Building The Circuit</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
We will be using the Arduino LCD module as our screen. You can find more
information on the screen 
<a target="_blank" href="https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/GTFT">here</a>, 
and we will show you how to wire it up properly below.
</p>

<p>
The wiring diagram for the screen is shown below. It assumes you are using
an Arduino Leonardo board. The breadboards we are using are slightly bigger
than the one shown, but that's okay. As long as you get the right wires in
the right place!

<h2>Checking The Circuit</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
To check we have connected the screen properly, lets run a small "Hello
World!" program. Open up your Arduino software, and open the example
under "<i></i>"
</p>

<p>
Hit <b>Upload</b> again, and hopefully, you will see the words 
"Hello World!" appear on your screen.
</p>
</div>

<h2>Programming The Screen</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
Now we will learn to program the screen and actually draw interesting stuff
on it.
