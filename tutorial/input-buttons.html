<h1>Pushing Buttons</h1>

<p>
Now we know how to use the screen, we need to make it more interractive. This
section will show you how to connect buttons and dials to your Arduino, and
use code to <i>read</i> a value from them.
</p>

<h2>Adding A Button</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
Let's start simple. We can really easily connect a button to our arduino
using only two wires and a little code. The diagram below shows how you can
do this. You'll notice that the diagram doesn't include the screen. That's
just to make things clearer, you'll have to work out how to fit the buttons
around the screen so you can press them easily later.
</p>

<p>
Diagram Here.
</p>

<p>
With the circuit all wired up, you can start coding. The code below can be used
along side the code from your screen. First though, lets try doing something
really simple like blinking a light when you press the button.
</p>

<div style="text-align:center; max-width:735px;">
<img src="images/ide-top.png"/>
{% highlight C linenos %}

// Code For Button Goes Here

{% endhighlight %}
<img src="images/ide-bottom.png"/>
</div><br/>

<p>
You should see that whenever you press the button, the light turns on! Not very
exciting, but think about how we can use this code to build our games? Can
you make something move on your screen based on button presses?
</p>
</div>

<h2>Adding A Dial</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
Buttons are great and all, but what about something twisty? Dials can be used
move characters, change speed, steer and all sorts of things. They are nice and
simple to wire up too. Again, the wiring diagram below only shows the dial, can
you fit it around the screen too?
</p>

<p>
Diagram Here.
</p>

<p>
Now we have everything wired up, lets make something on our screen change
based on our dial. When we read a value from the dial, we get a number
between 0 and 1023. We can use this as a position, or even a colour. The
code below will move a square up and down, and also change it's colour, based
on the position of the dial. Can you make the rectangle move differently if the
button is pressed as well? What about changing the shape?
</p>

<div style="text-align:center; max-width:735px;">
<img src="images/ide-top.png"/>
{% highlight C linenos %}

// Code For Dial Goes Here

{% endhighlight %}
<img src="images/ide-bottom.png"/>
</div><br/>

<p>
Congratulations! Now you know everything you need in order to start making
some awesome arcade games. The next section will show you how to build 
the classic <i>ping pong</i>, and give you some ideas about other games you
could try.
