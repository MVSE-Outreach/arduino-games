<h1>Ping Pong</h1>

<p>
We have everything we need, we've seen the code, the circuit is built.
Lets make a game! We'll start by breaking the game down into steps. This will
make it easier to develop, and is called <i>divide and conquer</i>, a really
common strategy for solving hard problems with code.
</p>

<h2>Divide and Conquer</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
So, how many steps are there in making ping pong? It can be supprisingly
complicated if you don't think about it a little first! We need a score
keeper, two bats, collision detection, input read code, and to display
all this on the screen. All fast enough so it doesn't run at a snails pace!
Harder than you thought huh? Never fear, we will build things up step by
step. Below is a list of all the stages we will go through in building the
game.
</p>
<ol>
<li>Keeping Score</li>
<li>Player Bats</li>
<li>Moving The Ball And Collisions</li>
<li>Winning!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Keeping Score</h2>
<div class="section">
<p>
Pong is a two player game, so we need to have two scores, and to be able to
read inputs from both players individually. Below is some example code with
small bits missing, can you fill them in so we can read the position of the
bats properly and display each players score?

Example Code

<p>
Got it working? This code will form the skeleton of our game, so all of the
other code will be <b>added</b> to what we have already written.
